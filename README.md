Тестовое задание iOS, Strong

Link to YouTube, where the working application is demonstrated: https://youtube.com/shorts/QHXATTJNgTc

## What is done from advanced: 
1. Use programmatic Autolayout
2. Use “skeleton views” for all the elements while API requests are performed 
3. Make the UI look and feel good for all the screen sizes including iPads (на усмотрение проверяющему)
4. Make the expand/collapse feature for CountriesList animated, with no UI bugs
5. Add the images caching and reuse them from cache (don’t download any image twice) (done with SDWebImage, downloaded as package)
6. Use “nice” naming (common readability, self-documenting code) (на усмотрение проверяющему)
7. Used MVVM for architecture
8. Write safe code, leave no possibility of crashes (I hope)
9. Make the “Capital coordinates” latitude + longitude value on the CountryDetails screen tappable
10. Add the pushes feature:
Make the push notification appear after 1-5 seconds after the app launch;
The push contains country and capital name; 
The user’s tap is handled by opening the corresponding country’s CountryDetails screen.
